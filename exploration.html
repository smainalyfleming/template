							<h2>The Problem</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Town of Deep River requires a web application</strong> but has a very limited budget. Our team will be exploring various platforms that can build a high quality, low-cost application that will be ideal to build this product on. The application 
							must fit our skillset, be of low budget, non-time consuming and produce a product with all the functionality required which are pop up tables, good basemaps, filtered searches and more.</p>
							<div class="content">
							<span class="pics2"data-position="center"><img src="Images/money.png" alt="Deep River" style ="width:300px; height:300px;" /></span>
								<p> Here is the the Problem Statement:
									<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
										<li><strong>Ideal</strong>:  Finding a low cost, user-friendly platform to develop a mobile application for Town of Deep River.</li>
										<li><strong> Reality </strong>: Reality: Town of Deep River has a very limited budget to own a premium web application.</li>
										<li><strong>Consequences</strong>:If no solution is found, the locals and visitors would have no access to a trail web/mobile app.</li>
										<li><strong>Proposal</strong>: The project will focus on exploring various low-cost platforms to efficiently display all the trails.</li>

							<h2>Our Journey</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<p>
					 We are team of three dynamic people with different interest and skills: two Cartographic Specialist and one Application specialist. 
							We started sharing our areas of strength focusing on the scope of our project. Regular meeting times were fixed and preferred method of contacts
						shared.</p>
						<p> In the beginning, all was going well, communication methods was set
						workflows were in order and we were on track. Unexpected closure of school really caused a massive 
						problem with our team. The communication which was once constant, was now much harder with other life complications
						such as family and hectic complicatons. On the verge of trouble, where we were overcoming these hurdles, we lost a team
							member which made it even harder to push forward. Nevertheless the team pushed forward. We first began by doing
							research on what are the platforms that have the capabilities to produce the application needed and we decided upon four(4) software.
							Google My Maps, Mapbox, ArcGIS Online and Leaflet.
							Afterwards we decided to use generalization techniques to simplify and smooth the trails for a better cartographic representation. The data was
							then converted into <strong>KML</strong> and <strong>GeoJSON</strong> file formats which can be used in the platforms above. Our first challenge came in <strong>Google
							MyMaps</strong>, where data of 5MB are more could not be imported. We got around this problem by splitting lines to make them into 
							smaller packages so the data could be imported. Immediately after seeing this problem, the team Google My Maps was not going
							to be the winnning platform. Our team started developing in <strong>Leaflet</strong> but with limited experience we found it very difficult
							operating this software and creating an application of high standard.
							<strong>Mapbox</strong> initially impressed us, with its beautiful basemaps and ability to create custom styles. Our team believes a very beautiful map
							can be made with this software, however, as the code started to become more complex. we slowly started to realize Mapbox might not be the way forward.
							with the time allocated to create this web application. 
							Finally our team explored <strong>ArcGIS Online</strong>, and we absolutely loved it. With the ability to configure pop up tables, quick development of application
							and high quality basemaps we determined the this software was the winning application to build the application for the Town of Deep River.

							<p> After research, Our team came to the conclusion, that we will be testing for the criteria listed above in four(4) software and analyzing which best achieves the solution. <strong>The four software </strong>:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					  <li><strong>Mapbox </strong><span class="pics2"data-position="center"><img src="Images/mapimage.jpg" alt="Map Box" style ="width:200px; height:120px;"  /></span></li>

							<h2>Mapbox</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Mapbox is a great platform for beautiful maps.</strong>. It is a mapping startup that offers users a platform for making custom maps based on OpenStreetMap and other open data.</p>
							<P> While we were having some issues with implementing programming skills, we started exploring options to overcome our challenges and found mapbox studio is one good fit for us which does not require any coding. 
							We published our trail layers to ArcGIS Online, exported them as a GeoJSON file and downloaded the GeoJSON file. Mapbox has simple solution to display layers without any coding. Mapbox has an option to add layers as 
							Tilesets and create styles form it. A tileset is a collection of raster or vector data broken up into a uniform grid of square tiles at 22 preset zoom levels, which is necessary to make map visible on mobile devices or in the browser.  </p>
							<p><strong>Supported format: </strong> </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Raster tilesets: tiff or Geotiff files </li>
								<li>Vector tilesets: GeoJSON, Shapefile, KML, or GPX files</li>
							</ul>

								<span> <iframe src="https://smainalyfleming.github.io/webgis/dtrails.html" width="640" height="480"></iframe></span>
								<br>
								<p> <strong>Road Blocks </strong>: We have not heard back from our clients on questions we have on trails. There are so many Jumbled trails which need to be splitted
									and make them look more visually appealing. We decided to try using different trails in different platforms just to see how they looks on web </p>
								<p><strong> Alternative option </strong></p>
								We realized the quality of map was not looking great. We decided to work around and code GeoJSON file, and reproduce another application.

						<h3> <u>Cost </u></h3>
					<p> Mapbox is free as long as the application provides free service up to 50,000 views per month. This works well for Town of Deep River
						<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Time </u></h3>	
						<p> Mapbox was very time consuming compared to the other applications. The margin of error is very high and our skillset was not up to standard to have a high quality application running in a couple weeeks. </p>

						<h3> <u>Cost </u></h3>
					<p> ArcGIS Online comes at a cost. Town of Deep River would not need a premium account for this so an estimated cost for a organization creator user account would be around 820/yr which is not too bad.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Time </u></h3>
