							<h2>The Problem</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Town of Deep River requires a web application</strong> but has a very limited budget. Our team will be exploring various platforms that can build a high quality, low-cost application that will be ideal to build this product on. The application 
							must fit our skillset, be of low budget, non-time consuming and produce a product with all the functionality required which are pop up tables, good basemaps, filtered searches and more.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>Along with research, Our team will be creating a mini demo on identified platforms. In these demos we will be testing for the criteria listed above and analyzing which software achieves the solution to the problem best. Advantages and Disadvantages will be documented as well with any challenges encountered. Keep scrolling to find out how we worked towards completing this!</p>

							<h2>Our Journey</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<p> Our journey started with little knowledges on trail maps. We are required to explore all possible options to compare one better than the other and that comes
						with low cost or free. We were team of three dynamic people with different interest and skills: two Cartographic Specialist and one Application specialist. Every journey
						starts with first step, we did. We started sharing our area of strength focusing on the scope of our project. Regular meeting times were fixed, preferred method of contacts
						shared and took litlle baby steps. </P>
						<p>There were a lot of challenges in the begining. Cartography specialist had only limited knowledge to 
								demonstrate programming skills, while giving all coding task to Application specialist was not always fair. At this point we realized we have a long journey to go. We are going to demostrate 
							step by step how we overcome all the challenges to find the perfect solution for our client.</P>

							<h2>Shortlisting the Software to explore</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p> After research, Our team came to the conclusion, that we will be testing for the criteria listed above in four(4) software and analyzing which best achieves the solution. The four software are:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Mapbox</li>
  <li>Google MyMaps</li>
  <li>Leaflet</li>
  <li> ArcGIS Online</li>

							<h2>Mapbox</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Mapbox is a great platform for beautiful maps.</strong>. It is a mapping startup that offers users a platform for making custom maps based on OpenStreetMap and other open data.</p>
							<P> While we were having some issues with implementing programming skills, we started exploring options to overcome our challenges and found mapbox studio is one good fit for us which does not require any coding. 
							We published our trail layers to ArcGIS Online, exported them as a GeoJSON file and downloaded the GeoJSON file. Mapbox has simple solution to display layers without any coding. Mapbox has an option to add layers as 
							Tilesets and create styles form it. A tileset is a collection of raster or vector data broken up into a uniform grid of square tiles at 22 preset zoom levels, which is necessary to make map visible on mobile devices or in the browser.  </p>
							<p><strong>Supported format: </strong> </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Raster tilesets: tiff or Geotiff files </li>
								<li>Vector tilesets: GeoJSON, Shapefile, KML, or GPX files</li>

						<h3> <u>Pop-up Table </u></h3>
					<span class="pics2"data-position="center"><img src="Images/mappopup.JPG" alt="Popup" style ="width:500px; height:400px;" /></span>
					<p> Mapbox provides an easy interactive on-click pop-up table that's easily configurable and portrays alot of information to users efficiently and effectively. </p>
					</div>
			<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Cost </u></h3>
					<p> Mapbox is free as long as the application provides free service up to 50,000 views per month. This works well for Town of Deep River
						div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Time </u></h3>	
						<p> Mapbox was very time consuming compared to the other applications. The margin of error is very high and our skillset was not up to standard to have a high quality application running in a couple weeeks. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="content">
						<h3> <u> Quality </u></h3>
						<p> The maps produced by mapbox are of the highest quality. The basemaps and ability to create styles are unmatched. Cartogram is also a very nice feature for creating styles of the fly.

						<h3>Mapbox</h3>
							<h3>Pros</h3>
							<ul><strong>
								<li>Allows for change and custom styles to be built by users. </li>
								<li>Applications creted with mapbox mobile SDKs can download maps for selected geographical areas for use when the device does not have network connectivity.</li>
								<li>Free limit of 50,000 views per month. Ideal for low traffic webmap./li>
								<li>High quality end products</li>
								</strong>
								
							</ul>
						<h3>Cons</h3>
							
								<ul><strong>
									<li>Too complicated for simple maps and data</li>
									<li>Second</li>

						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Next, we dived into ArcGIS Online.</strong> It is a collaborative web GIS that allows you to use, create, and share maps, scenes, apps, layers, analytics, and data. </p>

						<h3> <u>Pop-up Table </u></h3>
					<span class="pics2"data-position="center"><img src="Images/arcpop.JPG" alt="Popup" style ="width:500px; height:400px;" /></span>
					<p> ArcGIS Online also provides an easy interactive on-click pop-up table that's easily configurable and portrays alot of information to users efficiently and effectively. In addition it also allows the user to zoom into that feature which can be very useful for the application</p>
					</div>
			<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Cost </u></h3>
					<p> ArcGIS Online comes as a cost.</p>
						</div>
					<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Time </u></h3>	
						<p> The time was moderate for ArcGIS Online. A good application can be built really quickly and can be designed very well. We are more experienced with this item so goals can be met using this software much more effectively.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="content">
						<h3> <u> Quality </u></h3>
						<p> The maps produced by ArcGIS are of good quality. The basemaps are of a nice quality and there are plenty options which can be added to the a map that is suitable for the web application.

						<div class="content">
						<h3>Leaflet</h3>
							<p>The interactive map below was obtained through Leaflet. We used ArcGIS Pro to load the gathered shapefiles and then easily converting them to GeoJSON files with the Feature to JSON tool. These GeoJSON files were then used as input for building our LeafLet Map. </p>

						<h3> <u>Pop-up Table </u></h3>
					<span class="pics2"data-position="center"><img src="Images/LeafletPopupTable.png" alt="Popup" style ="width:500px; height:400px;" /></span>
					<p> On-click pop-up Tables are quite easy to configure on Leaflet using the onEachFeature option which is an a function that gets called on each feature before adding it to each GeoJSON layer. </p>
					</div>
			<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Cost </u></h3>
					<p> Leaflet is a free, open source application</p>
						<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Time </u></h3>	
						<p> Leaflet was very time consuming when configuring on-click popups tables, applying styling, or adding a legend for one large GeoJson file containing a large number of collection features as coding needed be repeated for all identified features which is error prone.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="content">
						<h3> <u> Quality </u></h3>
						<p> The obtained Leaflet map allows users to zoom and pan around, to interact with individual layers in order to access all relevant.It does also offer many styling and basemap options that may be extended with appropriate plug-ins.</p>

						<h3> Pros </h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>First :</strong> Layer interaction, zooming/ panning, adding pop-ips, legend, scale-bar. </li>
								<li><strong>Second :</strong> Allowing to easily adding Basemaps, Markers, circles and polygons to our map </li>
								<li><strong>Third :</strong> Includes adding GeoJson.</li>
								<li><strong>Fourth :</strong> Handles editing with plugins, and it’s easy to extend with plugins.</li>
								

							</ul>
						<h3>Cons</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>First :</strong> Despite offering options to add interactive control as shown below for searching features/ marker, it remains addioonal skills to add them for multiple layers.  </li>
